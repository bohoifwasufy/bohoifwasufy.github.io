Here are five tips on how to store wallpapers:</p><ol><li><p>Choose the right size: When deciding how much wallpaper to store, it’s important to take into account the space you have and the type of wallpaper you’re interested in. If your wallspace is small, try choosing a smaller wallpaper rather than a large one.</p></li><li><p>Use media organizers: When organizing your wallpaper collection, using media organizers can make life so much easier. For example, if you keep all your photos on individual albums, then each album will have its own organizer.</p></li></ol><h2 id=the-paul-rudolph-foundation--3d-hand-drawn-architectural--pinterest>The Paul Rudolph Foundation | 3D Hand Drawn Architectural | Pinterest<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-paul-rudolph-foundation--3d-hand-drawn-architectural--pinterest>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7e/80/1a/7e801abaea7763db91376b22e1cd7464.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.vq4V3ZzyV_4_4REolITtDgHaFD&pid=15.1"' alt="The Paul Rudolph Foundation | 3D Hand Drawn Architectural | Pinterest"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>lippo center architecture rudolph paul centre drawings hong kong architect bond building foundation rendering architectural plan house school stories hexagonal.</p></blockquote><p>Types of cool wallpaper:
